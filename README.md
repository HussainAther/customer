Title: Predicting Customer Churn in Telecom Industry

Description: In this project, you can explore and analyze a dataset from a telecom company containing customer information, usage patterns, and churn status (whether the customer has switched to a competitor or not). The objective is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to churn. This project involves various steps:

Data exploration and preprocessing: Analyze the dataset, handle missing values, perform feature engineering, and conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights.

Feature selection: Identify the most relevant features that can help in predicting customer churn.

Model selection and training: Evaluate and compare different machine learning algorithms suitable for classification tasks (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting). Train the selected model(s) using appropriate techniques like cross-validation.

Model evaluation and performance tuning: Assess the performance of the model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Fine-tune the model to optimize its performance by adjusting hyperparameters.

Deployment and visualization: Create a user-friendly interface or web application to demonstrate the predictive capabilities of the model. Visualize key insights and results using plots, charts, or interactive dashboards.

Documentation and presentation: Prepare a detailed project report, documenting your approach, methodology, findings, and results. Create a presentation highlighting the project's objectives, methodology, and key outcomes.

By working on such a project, you can showcase your skills in data preprocessing, feature selection, machine learning, model evaluation, and visualization. It also demonstrates your ability to handle real-world datasets and deliver actionable insights. Remember to emphasize the business impact and value of your project in your portfolio.
